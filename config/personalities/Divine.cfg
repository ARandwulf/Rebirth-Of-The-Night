The celestial realm awaits.
The worthy survive. Maybe you are not worthy afterall.
[levelup]
As evil grows, so shall I.
The unrighteous will burn!
Behold, the righteous flame!
Make thyself devout, and eternal life is granted.
Only the just walk the path of immortal light.
The fire that illuminates, also cleanses.
My flames burn only the unworthy.
Justice!

The light must remain. Do not let me fade, wielder.
