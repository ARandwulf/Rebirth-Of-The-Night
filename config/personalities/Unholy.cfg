Take pride in how swiftly you fall.
Mortality is truly divine.
Pain must be felt.
[levelup]
Suffer!
Darkness is a gift!
Do not run from your shadow!
Darkness reveals truth!
Shall we remind you of your vulnerability?
Do not conflate darkness with evil.
Embrace your pain!
Suffer or feel nothing!
Into the dark!

So this... this is how it feels.
